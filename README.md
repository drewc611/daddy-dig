## Directions (Start-to-Finish)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- A Cloudflare account with Workers AI access

### Installation (one-time setup)

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/templates.git
   cd templates/llm-chat-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate Worker type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm run cf-typegen
   ```

### Configure the system

1. Open `wrangler.jsonc` and confirm:
   - `MODEL_ID` is set to the model you want.
   - Any environment variables you need are defined for dev and production.
2. (Optional) Enable the model switcher by setting `MODEL_ALLOWLIST` to a comma-separated list of models.
3. (Optional) Update the system prompt in `src/index.ts` to define the assistant’s behavior.

### Development (local run)

Start a local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8787.

Note: Using Workers AI accesses your Cloudflare account even during local development, which will incur usage charges.

### Deployment (go live)

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Monitor (operations)

View real-time logs associated with any deployed Worker:

```bash
npm wrangler tail
```

## How It Works

### System Architecture (What We Bought & How It Fits Together)

This system is a complete chat application stack that includes:

1. **Frontend UI** (browser): A responsive chat interface served from `public/` that captures user input and renders streaming responses.
2. **API/Worker** (Cloudflare Workers): A serverless backend in `src/index.ts` that receives chat messages and streams responses via SSE.
3. **LLM Provider** (Workers AI): The model runtime accessed through the Workers AI binding, configured in `wrangler.jsonc`.
4. **Optional AI Gateway**: Adds caching, rate limiting, and analytics when enabled in the Worker.

**Data flow**

1. User sends a message in the browser UI.
2. The UI POSTs to `/api/chat`.
3. The Worker forwards the request to Workers AI and streams tokens back using SSE.
4. The UI renders the streaming response in real time.

### Backend

The backend is built with Cloudflare Workers and uses the Workers AI platform to generate responses. The main components are:

1. **API Endpoint** (`/api/chat`): Accepts POST requests with chat messages and streams responses
2. **Streaming**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming of AI responses
3. **Workers AI Binding**: Connects to Cloudflare's AI service via the Workers AI binding

### Frontend

The frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that:

1. Presents a chat interface
2. Sends user messages to the API
3. Processes streaming responses in real-time
4. Maintains chat history on the client side

## Customization

### Changing the Model

To use a different AI model, update the `MODEL_ID` variable in `wrangler.jsonc` (or set it as a Worker environment variable). You can find available models in the [Cloudflare Workers AI documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).

To allow users to upgrade or switch models from the UI:

1. Set a comma-separated allowlist in `MODEL_ALLOWLIST`, for example:
   ```
   MODEL_ALLOWLIST="@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast,@cf/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct"
   ```
2. Deploy the Worker. The UI will fetch `/api/config` and populate the model picker with the allowlisted models.
3. Select the desired model in the UI before sending messages.

### Using AI Gateway

The template includes commented code for AI Gateway integration, which provides additional capabilities like rate limiting, caching, and analytics.

To enable AI Gateway:

1. [Create an AI Gateway](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway) in your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Uncomment the gateway configuration in `src/index.ts`
3. Replace `YOUR_GATEWAY_ID` with your actual AI Gateway ID
4. Configure other gateway options as needed:
   - `skipCache`: Set to `true` to bypass gateway caching
   - `cacheTtl`: Set the cache time-to-live in seconds

Learn more about [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/).

### Modifying the System Prompt

The default system prompt can be changed by updating the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant in `src/index.ts`.

### Styling

The UI styling is contained in the `<style>` section of `public/index.html`. You can modify the CSS variables at the top to quickly change the color scheme.
